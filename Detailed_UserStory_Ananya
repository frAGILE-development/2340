6: Status of Lost Items
As a user, I want to see if my items were found, so that I can see if I can retrieve them yet

TASKS:

1. Create a front-end view page displaying a user's lost items and their statuses

2. If the item has been found, create a page with details about who found it, where it was found etc.

4. Create a controller to fetch the data to be loaded on the found item info page

ACCEPTANCE SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: 
Given that the lost item has been found, when the user opens the status page, then the item should be marked as found and be clickable taking them to the details page(who found it, where it was found etc.) of the item.

Scenario 2:
Given that the lost item has not been found, when the user opens the status page, then the item should be marked not found and be not clickable.
