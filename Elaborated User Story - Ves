2: User Registration

As a user, I need to create an account, so I can join the app.

tasks:
-create a registration page where the user can input their email, desired username and password.
-create a controller to create an account


scenario 1:
give: email is valid (of form [string]@[string].[string]), password meets standard (6 characters or longer), and desired username does not already belong to an account.

When the user meets these criteria, then an account should be created for them and proceed to show them the log in page


scenario 2:
given: email is not of valid form

When the user puts in an email that can't work, they should be shown a cleared registration page with a notification that the email inputted is not valid


scenario 3:
given: password is too short

When the user puts in a password that is too short, they should be shown a cleared registration page with a notification that the password inputted is too short


scenario 4:
given: username already exists for another account

When the user puts in a username that is already taken, they should be shown a cleared registration page with a notification that the username is already taken


Done Done criteria:
-User enters their account information
-If the information is valid, an account is created for the user
-When the user clicks register, the information is saved in the database and the user is taken to the log in page
