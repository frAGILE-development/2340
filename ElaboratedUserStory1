1: user login page
As a user, I want to access my account, so I can find my items.

Scenario 1: Login information is correct
Given the user already has an account

When the user inputs the correct username and password
Then the login page should login to the account 
    and proceed to the status of items page
   
Scenario 2: Login information is incorrect
Given there is a database of registered accounts

when the user inputs incorrect username and/or password
Then an error message should display 
    and should remain on the login screen.
